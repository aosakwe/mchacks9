# We have two traits to change in our schedule:
# 1) the order of our trains (and therefore the capacity)
# 2) the frequency of our trains (which will in turn affect the total capacity 
# in a given hour)

# Plotting the traffic over time shows us exactly when traffic peaks at each 
# station, and therefore when we need the greatest capacity and frequency

# The goal here is to first arrange the trains in an order that would match this 
# distribution,and then adjust the frequency/schedule to best accommodate the
# traffic.
